# local environment

## jupyter lab

In each playground project root (./langchain, autogen, etc...),
you can work on jupyter lab by hitting `poetry run jupyter lab`

## context files

often you want to put some files data into prompt when you query in chat-like application or any other apps.

`./raw_data` directory is shared place to put such files.
